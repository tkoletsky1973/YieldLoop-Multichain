**What YieldLoop does in one sentence**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| YieldLoop puts your money to work in sensible ways, keeps careful     |
| track of every                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| dollar earned, and only increases in value when real profit actually  |
| exists.                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| That\'s it. No gimmicks. No shortcuts. No promises it can\'t keep.    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Where does the money come from?**

The system earns income from four ordinary activities that have existed
in finance for a long time --- they just happen to run on digital
infrastructure:

  ------- ------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  **1**   **Small trades**    Buying and selling carefully between
                              different markets to capture small price
                              differences. Like a currency exchange desk
                              that moves quickly.

  **2**   **Liquidity fees**  Being a middleman when others make trades on
                              digital exchanges. Every trade that uses your
                              liquidity pays you a small fee.

  **3**   **Savings yield**   Earning interest on digital dollars parked in
                              conservative, established accounts. Similar
                              to a savings account, but digital.

  **4**   **Staking rewards** Being paid to help verify that a blockchain
                              network runs correctly. Reliable,
                              predictable, unrelated to market swings.

**What makes it different from other crypto things?**

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Most crypto projects do this:**   **YieldLoop does this instead:**

  ✗ Print new tokens to pay you       ✓ Only pay you from money actually
                                      earned

  ✗ Promise guaranteed returns        ✓ Honestly say: good months and
                                      flat months both happen

  ✗ Blend everyone\'s money together  ✓ Keep each month\'s accounting
                                      completely separate

  ✗ Collapse when new investors stop  ✓ Survive on its own earnings ---
  joining                             no new buyers needed

  ✗ Hide the math                     ✓ Show every number, every month,
                                      on a public ledger
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

**What It\'s Like to Actually Use It**

Here is the complete experience from start to finish --- no technical
steps, just what happens from your point of view.

**Step 1 --- You deposit money**

You go to the YieldLoop website. You put in money using your debit card,
credit card, or --- if you already use crypto --- a digital wallet. The
minimum is \$500.

You can deposit from almost anywhere. It works on Ethereum, Arbitrum,
Base, Polygon, or BNB Chain. If you don\'t know what those are, that\'s
fine --- the system handles the details automatically.

**Step 2 --- The vault runs for a month**

Your money is put to work across the four income sources. You don\'t
need to do anything. The system manages it. A small operational reserve
covers all fees so you never get a surprise deduction.

You can log in any time and see exactly what\'s happening. Nothing is
hidden.

**Step 3 --- Month end: you see your results**

At the end of each month, the vault closes its books. If real profit was
earned, two things happen:

-   A small amount gets permanently added to your floor price --- the
    minimum value of what you hold.

-   You decide whether to take your profit as cash (USDT) or keep it in
    the system as a LOOP certificate.

If it was a slow month with little or no profit, the floor simply stays
where it is. Nothing is lost. Nothing collapses. The system pauses, not
breaks.

**Step 4 --- You wait or you withdraw**

YieldLoop rewards patience. The longer you stay, the more the floor can
grow. There are holding periods depending on how much you hold --- from
45 days for small amounts up to 120 days for large ones.

If you need to leave early, you can. There is a small penalty that goes
to strengthen other participants. Everything is shown to you before you
confirm --- no surprises.

**Step 5 --- Withdrawal**

When your holding period is up, you redeem at the current floor price.
Funds are sent back to whichever chain or wallet you choose. No queue.
No waiting list. Instant execution.

|                                                                       |
| You put money in. The system earns income from four sensible sources. |

| automatically. At month end, if there was profit, your floor value    |
| increases slightly.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| You choose cash or reinvestment. You wait your holding period. You    |
| withdraw at a value                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| that has never gone down. Everything is transparent. Nothing is       |
| hidden.                                                               |

**If You Are New to All of This**

*A version of this for someone who has never owned a single digital coin
in their life.*

**Let\'s start with what you already understand**

You\'ve probably had a savings account. You put money in. The bank pays
you a little interest every month. The amount you put in never
disappears --- the bank uses it to make loans and gives you a share of
what it earns.

YieldLoop works on a similar idea, but instead of a bank, the system
earns income from digital financial markets. And instead of a bank
deciding how to use your money and keeping most of the profit, the rules
are written in computer code that everyone can read and nobody can
secretly change.

**What is \'crypto,\' really?**

Cryptocurrency is just digital money that runs on a shared computer
network instead of through a bank. Think of it like email compared to
sending a paper letter --- it\'s the same basic idea (sending value from
one person to another) but done differently, faster, and without a
middleman.

The most important digital currency for YieldLoop is called USDT ---
it\'s a digital dollar. One USDT is always worth one US dollar. There\'s
no price swing. It doesn\'t go up or down like Bitcoin does. It just
holds its value, like cash in your pocket.

**So what exactly is a \'vault\'?**

When you deposit into YieldLoop, you\'re opening a vault --- a personal
account that holds your money and puts it to work. Nobody else can touch
it. You can see everything that happens inside it. And when you want
your money back, you request it and it comes back to you.

The word \'vault\' is intentional. It\'s meant to feel like a safe,
locked container for your money --- not a gamble, not a lottery ticket,
not something that requires you to watch it every day.

**What is LOOP and why does it exist?**

When the vault earns profit in a month, you can keep that profit as LOOP
--- a kind of receipt or certificate that represents what you\'ve
earned. Think of it like a savings bond from the US government. You buy
a savings bond, it sits there, and over time it\'s worth more than you
paid for it.

LOOP works the same way. It has a floor price --- a minimum value. That
floor can only go up when real profit exists. It can never go down. Not
in a bad market. Not in a slow month. The floor is locked in by computer
code, not by a promise.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| A simple comparison that might help:                                  |
|                                                                       |
| Imagine a CD (certificate of deposit) at your bank --- but instead of |
| earning                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| a fixed rate set by the bank, it earns whatever the vault actually    |
| earned that                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| month. And instead of trusting the bank\'s word, every calculation is |
| public,                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| automatic, and permanently recorded so nobody can fudge the numbers.  |
|                                                                       |
| That\'s the spirit of what YieldLoop is doing.                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**What about the scary things you\'ve heard about crypto?**

The scary stories about crypto --- people losing everything, scams,
things blowing up overnight --- are mostly about a specific type of
project. Those projects promise huge returns, print fake tokens to pay
investors, and need a constant flow of new money to survive. When the
new money stops, everything collapses.

YieldLoop was built specifically in reaction to that pattern. It does
not print tokens to pay you. It does not need new investors to survive.
It does not promise big returns. It earns from real activity or it earns
nothing --- and it says so plainly.

**What if I want my money back?**

You can get your money back. The system has holding periods ---
typically 45 to 120 days depending on how much you have --- to give the
vault time to work properly. If you need to leave before your time is
up, you can, but you\'ll receive slightly less than the full amount.
Everything is shown to you clearly before you confirm anything.

There is no \'locked forever\' situation. There is no \'you must trust
us to release your funds\' situation. The rules are in the code, the
code is public, and the math is transparent.

**Is it guaranteed?**

No. It is not guaranteed. Nothing in investing is guaranteed. There are
real risks --- the computer code could have a bug, the digital markets
could behave unexpectedly, the platforms the system uses could have
problems.

The difference between YieldLoop and many other investments is this: the
risks are clearly described, the math is open for anyone to check, and
the system is designed to slow down and pause before it could ever fail
in a way that wipes people out.

Slow and steady, with honesty about what could go wrong. That is the
philosophy.

**Before You Open Anything Else**

A few things worth knowing before you go further:

-   YieldLoop does not promise returns. Good months and flat months both
