YIELDLOOP

Kitchen Table Talk

Plain Language Guide — The Complete Normie Journey, How Everything Works & What to Expect | v5.2

| This document is for real people. No technical background required. We start from scratch — you have a phone, a bank account, and maybe you've heard of Bitcoin. That's enough. |
| --- |


Part 1 — What Is YieldLoop?

YieldLoop is a system that puts your money to work in the crypto world and pays you back the profits. You stay in control at all times. Your money lives in your own personal vault — a digital safe that only you can open.

The company that built YieldLoop cannot access your vault. Nobody can move your money without your wallet. If YieldLoop the company disappeared tomorrow, your vault and everything in it would still be there on the blockchain.


| One thing to understand before anything else: YieldLoop charges a fee only on profits — never on your deposit. The fee starts at 12% and can only ever go down. It is impossible for the fee to increase. This is built into the code, not just a promise. |
| --- |

How the Fee Works in Plain English

Imagine your vault earns $100 in a month. At a 12% fee, YieldLoop takes $12 and you keep $88. Your original deposit is never touched. If the vault has a bad month and earns nothing, you pay nothing.

Over time the fee drops automatically for everyone as the protocol grows. And your own vault earns its own personal discount the more actively you use it. The best-case scenario for a committed long-term user is a 2.5% effective fee — that's 80% lower than where it starts.


Part 2 — Your Complete Journey

This section walks through everything from the moment you find YieldLoop to the day you decide to take your money out. We assume you are starting from zero.


Step 1 — You Land on the Site

You find YieldLoop from a friend, social media, or a search. You open it on your phone or computer. The first thing you see is the fee — the actual live fee, right there on the front page. Not buried in terms and conditions. Right at the top.


| YIELDLOOP LANDING PAGE<br><br>'Your money. Working harder.'<br>'Fee starts at 12% — only going down.'<br><br>Protocol fee today:  12.0%<br>Next drop to 11%:    [████████░░░░] 61% of the way to $1M<br><br>[ Start Earning ]    [ How It Works ]<br><br>─────────────────────────────────────────<br>No crypto experience needed.<br>Start with $1,000 USDT (a digital dollar).<br>An AI puts it to work. You collect the profits.<br>───────────────────────────────────────── |
| --- |


The bar showing progress to the next fee drop is live. You can watch the protocol growing in real time. When it crosses $1 million in total deposits, everyone's fee drops to 11% permanently. No action required from you — it just happens.


| Tap 'How It Works' if you want to understand everything before you sign up. No account needed. No wallet needed yet. Just read. |
| --- |


Step 2 — Setting Up a Wallet

A crypto wallet is your digital identity. Think of it like a bank account that only you control — no bank, no middleman. Your wallet is the key to your vault. Without it, nobody can access your money — including YieldLoop.


If You Already Have MetaMask or Trust Wallet

Tap 'Connect Wallet', select your wallet from the list, approve the connection. Done. Skip to Step 3.


If You've Never Had a Crypto Wallet

Tap 'Connect Wallet' then select 'Create New Wallet'. YieldLoop uses a service called Privy that makes this as simple as signing up for any app — just your email address or Google/Apple sign-in.


| CREATE YOUR WALLET — 3 STEPS:<br><br>1. Enter your email (or sign in with Google or Apple)<br>2. Verify with a 6-digit code sent to your phone<br>3. Your wallet is created<br><br>You'll be given a 12-word backup phrase.<br>This is the master key to everything.<br>Write it down. Right now. On paper. |
| --- |


| Your 12-word backup phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access to your device or account. YieldLoop cannot recover it for you. Nobody can. Write it on paper and store it somewhere safe — not in a text message, not in your email, not in a screenshot. A safe, a drawer, somewhere physical and secure.<br><br>To confirm you have it, you'll be asked to type back 2 random words from your phrase. You cannot proceed without doing this. |
| --- |


Step 3 — Buying USDT

USDT is a digital dollar. One USDT is always worth one US dollar. Your vault runs on USDT — you deposit it, profits come back in USDT, and when you close your vault you get USDT back.

If you don't have any USDT yet, you buy it directly inside the YieldLoop app using your bank card or a bank transfer. The service that handles this is called Transak — a regulated company used by hundreds of apps worldwide.


| BUY USDT — INSIDE YIELDLOOP:<br><br>1. Tap 'Add Funds' on your dashboard<br>2. Choose your payment method<br>   (Visa, Mastercard, bank transfer — varies by country)<br>3. Enter the amount in your local currency<br>   Example: £850 GBP → approximately $1,050 USDT<br>4. Review the exchange rate and Transak fee (typically 3–5%)<br>5. Complete ID verification if it's your first time<br>   (usually 2–5 minutes — required by law, handled by Transak)<br>6. Confirm — USDT arrives in your wallet within minutes |
| --- |


| Transak's fees and exchange rates are set by Transak, not YieldLoop. These are two separate companies. You pay Transak to buy USDT. You pay YieldLoop a percentage of profits earned. Always review the Transak screen carefully before confirming — you'll see exactly what you're getting before you pay. |
| --- |


Step 4 — The AI Conversation

Before your vault goes live, you have a short conversation with the YieldLoop AI. It asks you plain-language questions about your goals and translates your answers into vault settings. You don't need to understand any of the strategy details — that's the AI's job.


| SAMPLE AI CONVERSATION:<br><br>AI:  'Welcome. Let's set up your vault.<br>      What are you hoping to do with this money?'<br><br>You: 'I want to grow my savings. I'm nervous about<br>      losing money though.'<br><br>AI:  'That makes sense — protection first, growth second.<br>      I'd recommend Conservative settings.<br><br>      Here's what that means on your $1,200:<br><br>      Strategy:<br>        48% in staking (BNB earns interest)<br>        22% in lending pools (digital dollars earning yield)<br>        18% lending to Venus protocol (safe, stable)<br>        10% in spot trading (BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL)<br>         2% in cross-exchange arbitrage<br><br>      Realistic annual profit range: $45–$160<br>      Worst realistic month: about -$40 (temporary, recoverable)<br>      Your fee today: 12% on profits only — never on your $1,200<br><br>      As the protocol grows, your fee drops automatically.<br>      As you keep depositing, your vault earns its own discount.<br><br>      Want me to explain any part of this?'<br><br>You: 'What are XRP and SOL?'<br><br>AI:  'XRP is Ripple's token — a large, liquid cryptocurrency.<br>      SOL is Solana's token — another major crypto.<br>      On this network they trade as wrapped versions —<br>      same prices as the real thing, just in BSC format.<br>      On Conservative settings they're a small part of<br>      your trading allocation. The AI routes them to<br>      whichever exchange gives the best price.<br><br>      Want to see your full settings summary?' |
| --- |


| Advanced Mode lets you set your own strategy split, adjust individual token allocations, set your own stop-loss levels, and control exactly how profits are distributed. Most first-time users start with Basic Mode and switch to Advanced as they get comfortable. |
| --- |


Step 5 — The Acknowledgment

Before your vault activates, you see a full acknowledgment screen. Every box is separate. Nothing is pre-ticked. This is not a terms scroll — it's a real confirmation of what you're agreeing to.


| VAULT ACKNOWLEDGMENT:<br><br>[  ] I have reviewed all vault settings and understand them<br>[  ] I understand the fee starts at 12% on profits only<br>     and can only ever decrease — never increase<br>[  ] I understand fee decreases depend on protocol growth<br>     and are not guaranteed on any specific timeline<br>[  ] I understand the risks — I may lose all of my deposit<br>[  ] I understand the AI made recommendations — I accept<br>     sole responsibility for the settings I am activating<br>[  ] I understand USDT profits are claimable any time<br>[  ] I understand LOOP has no value outside YieldLoop<br>[  ] I understand YieldLoop cannot recover my wallet<br>     if I lose access — including in the event of my death<br>     or incapacitation. I accept full responsibility for<br>     securing my wallet credentials.<br>[  ] I confirm use of this protocol is legal in my country<br>[  ] I confirm I am not subject to international sanctions<br><br>Type exactly to activate:<br>I UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY<br>[___________________________________]<br>(Paste disabled. Autocomplete off. Must be typed manually.) |
| --- |


| Take this step seriously. The on-chain record of your acknowledgment is permanent. It includes what the AI recommended and what you agreed to. If something goes wrong, this is the record of the conversation. |
| --- |


Step 6 — Your Vault Is Live

You confirm the transaction in your wallet, and your vault activates. You'll see a confirmation screen and then your dashboard.


| VAULT ACTIVATED!<br><br>Vault 1  \|  Conservative  \|  $1,182 USDT  \|  ● Active<br><br>Fee status:<br>  Protocol today:  12.0%<br>  Your vault:      12.0%  (accelerator just starting)<br>  Your rate:       12.0%  (no NFT yet)<br><br>Next protocol drop: 11% at $1M AUM  [61% there]<br><br>What happens now:<br>  ✓ AI is managing your strategy<br>  ✓ Profits will appear here as trades close<br>  ✓ Check back any time — no action needed from you |
| --- |


About $18 of your deposit was automatically set aside as a gas reserve — this is the small fee the BNB chain charges to process transactions. The AI uses this to operate your vault. You never need to manually pay gas.


Part 3 — Living With Your Vault

Checking Your Dashboard

Any time you open YieldLoop, your dashboard shows everything at a glance. Your balance, available profits, current fee rate, accelerator progress, and how close the whole protocol is to the next fee drop.


| YOUR DASHBOARD — 30 DAYS LATER:<br><br>Protocol: 12.0%  \|  AUM $687K  \|  $313K to next drop  [69%]<br><br>Vault 1  Conservative  $1,196  ● Active<br>  Protocol: 12.0%  \|  Vault: 11.91%  \|  Effective: 11.91%<br>  Accelerator: 0.09pp earned  (keep depositing regularly!)<br><br>This month:<br>  Profit earned:    $16.80<br>  Fee paid:          $2.00  (on profit only, not your balance)<br>  USDT ready:       $11.70  ← claim any time<br>  LOOP issued:       5.10 LOOP @ $1.00<br><br>Accelerator signals:<br>  Balance:      ██░░░░  Improving<br>  Volume:       █░░░░░  Low — try adding $250<br>  Frequency:    ██░░░░  1 deposit — add regularly<br>  Quality:      ███░░░  Net positive, consistent |
| --- |


| Your vault is already earning a tiny accelerator discount after one month. The more regularly you deposit — even $250 at a time — the faster this grows. After a year of consistent deposits, you could be 1–2pp below the protocol rate before any NFT discount. |
| --- |


Claiming Your USDT Profits

USDT profits settle continuously as trades close. There is no monthly wait. When you see a USDT balance on your dashboard, it is ready to claim immediately.


| CLAIM USDT:<br><br>1. Dashboard shows 'USDT Ready: $11.70'<br>2. Tap [ Claim USDT ]<br>3. Confirm in your wallet (tiny gas fee — a few cents)<br>4. $11.70 lands in your wallet within seconds<br><br>No forms. No waiting. No minimums. Claim whenever you like. |
| --- |


Some people claim every week. Some let it build for months. Some reinvest it straight back into their vault. It's your money — completely your choice.


Understanding LOOP

LOOP is different from USDT. Instead of sitting in your wallet, it stays inside YieldLoop and grows over time. When you earn LOOP, it's issued at exactly $1.00. Then periodically the protocol permanently increases what all existing LOOP is worth.


| EXAMPLE — HOW LOOP GROWS:<br><br>Month 1:   50 LOOP issued at $1.000<br>Month 2:   48 LOOP issued at $1.000<br>           [ratchet fires: +0.75% — all your LOOP now worth $1.0075]<br>Month 4:   [ratchet fires: +0.50% — your Month 1 LOOP worth $1.012]<br>Month 7:   [ratchet fires: +0.80%]<br>Month 12:  Your original Month 1 LOOP has had 5 ratchet events<br>           $1.000 × 1.0075 × 1.005 × 1.008 × ... = ~$1.038 each<br><br>           The 50 LOOP you received in Month 1<br>           is now worth $51.90 — without doing anything.<br><br>Hard commitment: the ratchet fires at minimum once per quarter<br>when the protocol pools are healthy. It is not discretionary. |
| --- |


| LOOP has zero value outside YieldLoop. If the protocol ever stopped operating, LOOP would be worthless. Only hold LOOP if you believe in the protocol long-term. If you're unsure, set your vault to USDT-only profits — you can always change it later.<br><br>Also: if you do an immediate vault exit (leaving before month end), the LOOP you've earned in the current incomplete month is forfeited. All LOOP from fully completed past months is always safe — it cannot be taken away under any circumstances. |
| --- |


| REDEEM LOOP FOR USDT (any time):<br><br>1. Tap [ LOOP Portfolio ]<br>2. Select which months to redeem<br>   Shown: '312 LOOP × $1.038 = $323.86'<br>3. Tap [ Redeem to USDT ]<br>4. USDT lands in your vault balance immediately |
| --- |


Adding More Money

You can add to your vault any time. Minimum is $250 per deposit. Each deposit improves your accelerator score, which lowers your fee. Regular small deposits beat one big annual deposit for accelerator purposes.


| ADD TO VAULT:<br><br>1. Tap [ Add Funds ] on your vault<br>2. Enter amount (minimum $250)<br>   If you have deposit credits: shown and applied automatically<br>   'Credit available: $5.00 — applied to this deposit'<br>3. Confirm in your wallet<br>4. Done — balance updates, accelerator score improves |
| --- |


Referring a Friend

Every vault holder automatically gets a referral code. Share it with anyone. When they sign up and make their first deposit, you both receive a $5 deposit credit exactly one month later.


| HOW REFERRALS WORK:<br><br>1. Find your referral code: tap [ Referral ] in your menu<br>   Your code: YL-7F3A-K9<br>2. Share it with a friend<br>3. Friend signs up at yieldloop.io using your code<br>4. Friend makes their first deposit<br>5. Exactly 30 days later:<br>   → You receive: $5 deposit credit<br>   → They receive: $5 deposit credit<br>   → Both can use credits on their next $250+ deposit<br><br>Requires: friend must be a genuinely new user<br>(no prior YieldLoop account) |
| --- |


The Fee Estimator

Before committing to anything — before buying an NFT, before deciding how much to deposit — use the fee estimator. It's on the front page and on your dashboard. Put in your numbers and see exactly what your fee trajectory looks like.


| FEE ESTIMATOR INPUTS:<br>  How much are you depositing?      $5,000<br>  Monthly top-up amount?            $500<br>  How often will you deposit?       Monthly<br>  NFT tier?                         None (for now)<br>  How long are you planning for?    24 months<br><br>FEE ESTIMATOR OUTPUT:<br>  Month 1:    12.0% (launch rate)<br>  Month 6:    11.4% (protocol at $2M, 0.6pp accelerator)<br>  Month 12:   10.2% (protocol at $5M, 1.8pp accelerator)<br>  Month 18:    9.0% (protocol at $12M, 2pp accelerator)<br>  Month 24:    9.0% (estimated)<br><br>  With Genesis Core NFT added at Month 6:<br>  Month 6:     9.1% → 7.3% (20% off 9.1%)<br>  Month 12:    8.2% → 6.6%<br>  Month 24:    7.2% → 5.8%<br><br>  Core NFT break-even at current profit rate: ~11 months<br><br>  All figures estimated — not guaranteed.<br>  AUM growth timeline depends on protocol adoption. |
| --- |


Discovering NFTs

Most people discover the Genesis NFTs a month or two in, when they notice the fee display and wonder if it can drop faster. After 60 days your dashboard shows a prompt when the numbers make sense for your vault.


| DASHBOARD PROMPT (appears after ~60 days):<br><br>  'Your vault has earned a 0.38pp accelerator.<br><br>   Current rate: 11.62%<br>   With Genesis Core (20% off): 9.30%<br><br>   At your current profit rate, Core pays for itself<br>   in about 13 months — then saves money every month after.<br><br>   Plus: your vault ceiling raises from $200K to $400K.<br>   Plus: monthly deposit credits worth ~$8–$40/month<br>         depending on protocol scale.<br><br>   [ Learn About Genesis NFTs ]' |
| --- |


What Happens When You Buy a Genesis Core NFT

Buy on the NFT page — $1,000 USDT

NFT arrives in your wallet as a digital token

Tap [ Apply to Vault ] in your vault settings

Vault ceiling immediately raises to $400,000

Fee discount activates at the next epoch close (up to 30 days)

Deposit credits begin accumulating from the next epoch


| Once you apply an NFT to a vault, it is permanently bound to that vault. It cannot be moved. Make absolutely sure you're applying it to the right vault. Unbound NFTs can be sold on secondary market — bound ones cannot. |
| --- |


The Three Tiers at a Glance

|  | Genesis Lite |
| --- | --- |
| Price | $150 |
| Discount | 10% off your best rate |
| How long | 13 months from application |
| Vault ceiling | $200K (no change) |
| Monthly credits | None |
| Clock rule | Runs continuously — dormancy does not pause it |


Using Multiple Vaults

You can run more than one vault. This is intentional — it's a feature, not a workaround. Here are common reasons people do it:

Different risk levels: Conservative vault for money you can't afford to lose, Growth vault for money you're happy to take more risk with

Strategy separation: one vault for steady stablecoin yield, one for active crypto trading

NFT optimization: put your Maxi NFT on your biggest vault, Core on a second

Automatic overflow: when Vault 1 fills up, profits spill into Vault 2 automatically


| MULTI-VAULT EXAMPLE:<br><br>Vault 1  Conservative  $45,000  Genesis Maxi  2.5% eff rate<br>Vault 2  Balanced      $8,200  Genesis Core  5.8% eff rate<br>Vault 3  Growth        $3,100  No NFT        9.0% eff rate<br><br>Combined balance: $56,300  ← qualifies for governance rights<br>Total LOOP accumulated: 1,842 LOOP @ $1.041 = $1,917<br><br>Overflow routing:<br>  Vault 1 overflow → Vault 2<br>  Vault 2 overflow → Vault 3 |
| --- |


| Governance eligibility is based on your combined balance across all vaults. If your total across all vaults reaches $10,000, you qualify for a governance vote. One wallet = one vote regardless of how large your total balance is. |
| --- |


Your Epoch Summary

At the end of every month, YieldLoop sends you an epoch summary. On your dashboard always, by email if you've opted in.


| EPOCH SUMMARY — MONTH 4:<br><br>Your vault this month:<br>  USDT settled:         $18.40  (available to claim)<br>  LOOP issued:          14.20 LOOP @ $1.000<br>  Fee paid:              $2.21  (on profits only)<br>  Net profit:           $16.19 after fees<br><br>Your rate:<br>  Effective rate:       11.53%  (was 11.62% — improved!)<br>  Accelerator earned:   0.47pp  (was 0.38pp — keep it up)<br>  Signal: Volume ↑  Frequency ✓  Balance ↑  Quality ✓<br><br>Protocol:<br>  AUM:                  $824K   (next drop at $1M — 82% there!)<br>  Protocol rate:        12.0%   (no change this month)<br>  Last ratchet:         32 days ago (+0.75%)<br>  LOOP now worth:       $1.0075 per LOOP<br>  Days to quarterly min: 58 days<br><br>Your LOOP portfolio:<br>  Total LOOP:           62.4 LOOP<br>  Current value:        $62.87 |
| --- |


Part 4 — Getting Your Money Out

The Normal Way — Standard Closure

At any point you can close your vault and receive everything back in USDT. The cleanest approach is to request closure a few days before the end of the month. This gives the AI time to wind down positions cleanly with no penalties.


| STANDARD VAULT CLOSURE:<br><br>1. Tap [ Close Vault ] in vault settings<br>2. Select 'Standard closure — end of month'<br>3. You see a wind-down schedule:<br>   'Spot positions:    closing within 24–48 hours'<br>   'LP positions:      exiting within 24–48 hours'<br>   'Venus lending:     immediate redemption'<br>   'Staking:           unbonding begins — ~7 days'<br>4. Confirm — vault enters wind-down mode<br>5. Over the next few days USDT accumulates in your<br>   claimable balance as each strategy closes<br>6. Staking unbond arrives last (up to 7 days)<br>7. All clear — vault closed, everything in your wallet<br><br>Cost: nothing extra. Normal fee on profits earned.<br>Your deposit comes back in full (minus any strategy losses). |
| --- |


The Urgent Way — Immediate Exit

If you need your money right now — an emergency, an unexpected bill, or you've simply changed your mind — you can exit immediately. Here is exactly what it costs, shown before you confirm anything.


| IMMEDIATE EXIT — WHAT YOU SEE BEFORE CONFIRMING:<br><br>Vault balance:                      $1,247.60<br><br>Friction costs to close now:<br>  Gas fees:                             $4.90<br>  Exchange exit fees:                   $9.80<br>  LP pool exit:                         $7.60<br>  Slippage estimate:                    $5.80<br>  Staking unbonding penalty:            $4.60<br>  Total friction:                      $32.70<br><br>Urgency premium (20% of friction):    $6.54<br><br>Arb pool portion:<br>  $124.70 settling separately within 48 hours<br>  No additional fees on this portion<br><br>You receive now:                   $1,083.66<br>Arb portion (within 48h):           $124.70<br>Total you receive:                 $1,208.36<br><br>LOOP status:<br>  Past months LOOP (fully issued):  SAFE — 312 LOOP<br>  This month's LOOP (not yet issued): FORFEITED — 8.4 LOOP = $8.40<br><br>Total vs waiting for month end:    ~$47.60 saved by waiting<br><br>[ ← Go Back — Wait for Month End ]   [ I Understand — Exit Now ] |
| --- |


The numbers are always real. The 'Go Back' option is always as prominent as 'Exit Now'. The cost of leaving early is shown in dollars, not percentages. Your past months' LOOP is always listed as safe — only this month's unissued LOOP is ever at risk.


| The urgency premium goes to the protocol's safety pools — it makes the system healthier for everyone who stays. It's not a punishment, it's the cost of unwinding positions that weren't designed to close instantly. If you can wait even a few days, it's almost always worth it. |
| --- |


Part 5 — The Eight Tokens

Your vault works with eight different assets. You don't need to understand them all — the AI manages everything. But here's plain English on each one and what it does in your vault.


| Token | What It Is |
| --- | --- |
| Bitcoin (BTC) | The original cryptocurrency. Worth tens of thousands of dollars. |
| Ethereum (ETH) | The blockchain most of DeFi runs on. Second largest crypto. |
| BNB | The coin of the network YieldLoop runs on. |
| XRP | Ripple's coin. Large, liquid, widely traded. |
| SOL | Solana's coin. Popular, high volume. |
| USDT | A digital dollar — always worth $1. |
| USDC | Another digital dollar — slightly different issuer. |
| DAI | A decentralised digital dollar — backed by crypto, not a company. |


The 30% Rule

Your vault can never have more than 30% of its value in volatile crypto (BTC + ETH + BNB + XRP + SOL combined). At least 70% is always in digital dollars (USDT, USDC, DAI). This is a permanent rule that even the AI cannot break. It's there to protect your capital.


How New Tokens Get Added

The protocol can vote to add new tokens for spot trading over time. Any new token needs 90 days of history on the network, a verified price feed, and $5M in average daily trading volume before it can even be considered. If a new token is approved, you get 7 days notice and can opt your vault out before it becomes active.


Part 6 — Protecting Your Vault

Wallet Security

Your vault is as secure as your wallet. If someone gets your seed phrase, they get your vault. Full stop. Here's what to do:

Write your seed phrase on paper. Store it somewhere physically safe. Not on your phone, not in your email, not anywhere digital.

Make a backup copy and keep it somewhere separate — a different room, a different building if your balance is significant.

For larger balances, consider a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor. These keep your private key offline and are much harder to compromise.

Tell a trusted person that your vault exists and where to find your recovery information — in case something happens to you. Don't give them direct access while you're alive unless you've set up proper legal protections.


What Happens If You Die or Can't Access Your Account

This is an uncomfortable topic but an important one. YieldLoop is non-custodial. That means:

YieldLoop cannot recover your wallet if you lose access

YieldLoop cannot transfer your vault to your family, your estate, or anyone else

A court order, power of attorney, or probate document cannot unlock a vault

If your seed phrase is lost and your device is gone, the funds may be permanently inaccessible


The solution is estate planning for your digital assets. Put your seed phrase recovery instructions in a sealed envelope with your will. Note the YieldLoop vault exists. A solicitor or estate lawyer can hold it. Your family can be told it exists without being given direct access while you're alive.


| This is not unique to YieldLoop — it applies to all non-custodial crypto. Anyone holding crypto in a wallet they control faces this reality. The people who plan for it protect their family. The people who don't can leave their family with no way to access funds they knew existed. |
| --- |


Part 7 — Taxes

YieldLoop cannot tell you what taxes you owe. Tax law for crypto varies enormously by country and changes frequently. What YieldLoop can do is give you everything your accountant needs.


The Tax Export

From your transaction history page, you can download a CSV file (spreadsheet) of every single thing that happened in your vault. Every deposit, every profit claim, every LOOP issuance, every fee paid, every trade the AI made — all of it, with timestamps and USD values at the time.

| In many countries, yield from crypto is treated as income. In others it's capital gains. Some countries tax both. A few have specific DeFi rules. Your accountant or a crypto tax specialist in your country is the right person to interpret this data for your situation. |

Part 8 — LoopLab

Ten percent of every Genesis NFT sold goes to LoopLab. It's not a marketing budget. It's not a company expense. It's a separate organization with a mission.


What LoopLab Does

LoopLab's mission is to give people who've been left behind by the technology economy a real way in. Not theory — actual skills that lead to actual income.


Training in fintech, Web3, blockchain, and digital financial tools

Mobile app and web development — build things, ship things

Automation and workflow technology — make work smarter

Robotics and physical computing — the hands-on side of tech

Drone operation and applications — a fast-growing field


LoopLab also works with local small businesses. A restaurant owner, a tradesperson, a market vendor — anyone who wants to ask 'how can technology make my business better?' can come to LoopLab and get practical help, not an enterprise sales pitch.


How It's Run

LoopLab has an Executive Director — a real person responsible for running the organization, pursuing grants, managing finances, and making sure the mission is actually happening. Every program that receives funding has to report measurable outcomes: people trained, businesses helped, jobs found. Programs that produce results get continued funding. Programs that don't, don't.

Grant allocations above $10,000 require a governance vote from YieldLoop users who qualify. The community has a say in where the money goes.


The Connection

Every NFT you buy sends 10% to LoopLab. Every fee you pay at protocol scale contributes to the pool that funds it. Your participation in YieldLoop is your participation in this. Not because you have to — because the protocol is built that way.


| The founders built LoopLab because they believe technology access is a lever. Pull it for people who've never had the chance and remarkable things happen. YieldLoop's commercial success and its social purpose are, by design, the same thing. |
