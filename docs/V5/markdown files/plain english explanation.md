-----

## What Is YieldLoop?

YieldLoop puts your money to work in the crypto world and pays you back the profits. You deposit digital dollars (called USDT), an AI manages a mix of strategies to generate yield, and the profits come back to you. Your money stays in your own personal vault — a digital safe that only you can open. YieldLoop the company cannot access it. Nobody can.

> **The single most important thing:** YieldLoop charges a fee only on profits — never on your deposit. The fee starts at 12% and can only ever go down. It is impossible for it to increase. This is built into the code.

-----

## How the Fee Works

If your vault earns $100 in a month, YieldLoop takes $12 and you keep $88. If your vault earns nothing, you pay nothing. Your original deposit is never touched by the fee.

The fee drops automatically over time — two ways at once:

- As more people join the protocol, the fee drops for everyone. It goes from 12% down to 11%, then 10%, 9%, 8%, and eventually 7% as total deposits grow. Every drop is permanent — it can never go back up.
- Your own vault earns a personal discount the more actively and regularly you use it. Up to 2 percentage points extra off, on top of the protocol drops.

|Protocol Total Deposits|Fee Rate — Everyone          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
|At launch              |12%                          |
|Crosses $1 million     |Drops to 11% — permanent     |
|Crosses $5 million     |Drops to 10% — permanent     |
|Crosses $15 million    |Drops to 9% — permanent      |
|Crosses $40 million    |Drops to 8% — permanent      |
|Crosses $100 million   |Drops to 7% — permanent floor|


> The lowest possible effective fee is **2.5%** — that’s for a user with a Genesis Maxi NFT, a fully earned personal discount, and the protocol at $100M+ in total deposits. Most users working toward this can realistically reach 4–6% within 12–18 months.

-----

## What Strategies Does It Use?

The AI spreads your money across five different ways of earning:

- **Lending** — your digital dollars earn interest by being lent to borrowers on platforms like Venus
- **Staking** — BNB earns a return by supporting the network’s operations
- **Liquidity pools** — your funds earn trading fees by being paired with other assets in pools
- **Spot trading** — the AI buys BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, or SOL and sells when they hit profit targets
- **Cross-exchange arbitrage** — the AI earns small profits from price differences between exchanges

Your vault always has at least 70% in digital dollars (stable, not volatile). The other 30% or less can be in crypto like Bitcoin or Solana. You choose how aggressive or conservative you want to be — the AI handles the rest.

-----

## The Eight Tokens

|Token         |What It Is                  |
|--------------|----------------------------|
|Bitcoin (BTC) |Original cryptocurrency     |
|Ethereum (ETH)|Second largest crypto       |
|BNB           |Network’s own coin          |
|XRP           |Ripple’s coin               |
|SOL           |Solana’s coin               |
|USDT          |Digital dollar — always $1  |
|USDC          |Another digital dollar      |
|DAI           |Decentralised digital dollar|

-----

## LOOP — The Loyalty Credit

Alongside your regular dollar profits, you can earn LOOP — an internal credit that grows over time. It starts at $1.00 each. Periodically the protocol permanently increases what all existing LOOP is worth.

**Simple example:**

|Event                        |Value          |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
|You receive 100 LOOP at $1.00|= $100         |
|3 ratchet events later       |100 LOOP = $103|
|6 ratchet events later       |100 LOOP = $107|

You did nothing — LOOP just grew.

**Hard commitment:** LOOP grows at minimum once per quarter when the protocol is healthy. Not discretionary.

> LOOP only has value inside YieldLoop. It cannot be spent or traded elsewhere. If you do an emergency exit before month-end, the current month’s unissued LOOP is lost — but everything from past completed months is always safe and can never be taken away.

-----

## Genesis NFTs — Faster, Lower Fees

Three NFT tiers give you a permanent percentage off your fee rate. The discount is applied on top of whatever rate your vault has already earned.

|               |Lite                         |Core             |Maxi             |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|Cost           |$150                         |$1,000           |$3,000           |
|Fee discount   |10% off your rate            |20% off your rate|50% off your rate|
|Duration       |13 months (clock always runs)|Lifetime         |Lifetime         |
|Vault ceiling  |$200K                        |$400K            |$1M              |
|Monthly credits|None                         |~$8–38/mo        |~$20–94/mo       |


> Once you apply an NFT to a vault it stays there permanently — it cannot be moved. Unbound NFTs can be sold. Bound ones cannot.

-----

## Multiple Vaults

You can run more than one vault at the same time — different risk levels, different strategies, different NFTs. Your vaults can even overflow into each other automatically when one fills up. Governance eligibility is based on your combined balance across all vaults.

-----

## Referrals

Every vault holder gets a referral code automatically. When a friend signs up using your code and makes their first deposit, you both receive a $5 deposit credit exactly 30 days later. Simple as that.

-----

## Getting Started

1. **Get a crypto wallet** — either use one you have (MetaMask, Trust Wallet) or create one inside YieldLoop in about 2 minutes
1. **Buy USDT** — use the built-in Transak service to buy digital dollars with your bank card
1. **Have an AI conversation** — tell it your goals, it recommends settings, shows you the fee path and worst case. After you approve the recommendations, the AI populates the strategy screen for you — review it, make any adjustments, then authorize it for final trade activation
1. **Read and individually confirm the acknowledgment** — 10 boxes, nothing pre-ticked
1. **Activate your vault** — it’s live and the AI starts working

> ⚠️ **Your 12-word wallet backup phrase is the master key to everything.** Write it on paper and store it somewhere safe. If you lose it and lose access to your device, your funds may be permanently gone. YieldLoop cannot recover wallets for anyone — including in the event of death or incapacitation.

-----

## Getting Your Money Out

**Standard closure at month-end:** no penalty, no urgency fee. Just give a few days notice and the vault winds down cleanly, returning everything to your wallet in USDT.

**Immediate exit:** always available. You pay the actual costs of closing positions early (exchange fees, gas, slippage) plus a 20% urgency fee on those costs. You see the exact dollar amount before confirming. All your past completed months’ LOOP is always safe — only the current in-progress month’s LOOP would be lost.

-----

## Taxes

YieldLoop can’t tell you what taxes you owe — that depends on your country. What it can do is give your accountant everything they need: a complete CSV download of every transaction, with timestamps, amounts, and USD values at the time. Available any time, for any date range.

## LoopLab

LoopLab is an independent organization with a focused mission: connecting underserved communities to technology — exposure, education, services, and opportunities. Starting locally in rural Maryland with broader regional reach, LoopLab works to give people who might never have access to technology a real pathway in.

LoopLab is funded by two streams built directly into the protocol:

- 10% of every Genesis NFT sale goes to LoopLab
- 10% of all platform fees go to LoopLab

Initially, those funds cover an Executive Director salary — whose sole job is to build the program and ensure money flows to initiatives that produce real, measurable outcomes.

Overflow funds beyond operating costs are redirected into the YieldLoop system deposit. That deposit earns yield, pays platform fees (which feed back into LoopLab), and contributes to the redemption and ratchet pools. The result is a self-sustaining funding loop that compounds over time.

LoopLab works across four pillars: **Tech Access, Tech Education, Tech Services, and Tech Opportunities.** It also helps local small businesses find practical technology solutions. Governance participation — including grant votes — requires vault ownership with a good AI rating and a Core or Maxi NFT.

> Every NFT purchase, every fee paid at scale — a piece of that goes to LoopLab. Your participation in YieldLoop is participation in this. The protocol’s commercial success and its social mission are, by design, the same thing.

## Security

YieldLoop will not launch on the main network without a completed independent security audit and an active bug bounty program. Both are required and non-negotiable. All audit reports are published publicly before launch.
